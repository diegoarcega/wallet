# wallet
Wallet of Fiat currencies. Exchange and store your currencies in one platform

# Frontend Engineer

## Coding Challenge
We're looking for people who can build awesome products, so we created the following challenge to test your developer skills. We are looking for a creative mind that can bring best practices and UX together.

We would like you to create a React wallet that can handle different currencies (USD, EUR, CHF, etc) and exchange them between each other.

E.g. John Doe's wallet (Default currency = USD)
- USD balance: 100 USD
- EUR balance: 500 EUR
- CHF balance: 10000 CHF
- Totalised value in USD = 10237.79 USD

Users will be able to exchange from one currency to the other one. Hence, John can decide to exchange his 100USD to his Euro account. After the conversion, he will end up having:

*Considering 1 EUR = 1.24 USD*
- USD balance: 0 USD
- EUR balance: 580.42 EUR
- CHF balance: 10000 CHF
- Totalised value in USD = 10684.50 USD

The app should have the following features:
* Exchange between currencies
* Deposit a currency
* Show balance of each currency
* Show totalised value (across all your currencies) in the user's default currency
* Set user's default currency

### Criteria
You will be evaluated primarily on:
- React modern practices
- Code reusability (try making reusable components)
- Asynchronous programming
- Error handling
- Consistency of coding style
- Test coverage
- Accesibility
- Responsiveness
- Design style and UX

### Notes
- Deadline: you should take no more than 2 days to work on this challenge. No matter whether you completed it or not, send your progress.
- Language: Use ReactJS and feel free to use any library you think it helps organising, writing a better code, managing states, etc.
- Deliverables:
    - **Private** repo (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc). We will pay attention on how you commit code.
    - Document the exact steps to run the app and describe libraries used and why you have chosen them. Feel free to comment any additional ideas.
- Tip: Make your own decisions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
